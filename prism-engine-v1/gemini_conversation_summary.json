  "title": "Roadmap to a Native AI App with Tauri and Llama.cpp",
  "summary": "This conversation outlines a phased approach for transitioning from a Docker-based, web-app chatbot to a high-performance native macOS application using Tauri and llama.cpp. It addresses key pain points, provides a clear roadmap, and offers guidance on necessary tools and learning paths.",
  "phases": [
    {
      "phase_title": "Current Accomplishments",
      "details": [
        "Built a feature-rich chatbot with functions like conversation memory, undo/redo, and a stop button.",
        "Successfully containerized the app using Docker, with Ollama as the backend and a React/Vite frontend.",
        "Published the Dockerized app on GitHub.",
        "Has an Apple Developer account, signaling the intent to build and distribute a native app."
      ]
    },
    {
      "phase_title": "Transitioning to a Native App",
      "details": [
        "**Key Architectural Shift**: Moving from a web-based server model to a single, compiled `.app` file.",
        "**New Technology Stack**: Transitioning from Python/React/Ollama to a C++ (`llama.cpp`) backend and a native-compiling GUI framework like Tauri.",
        "**Why Tauri is a Good Choice**: It provides the performance of a native app with the developer-friendly workflow of web technologies (Rust backend, web frontend)."
      ]
    },
    {
      "phase_title": "Overcoming Compilation and Tooling Problems",
      "details": [
        "**Problem**: Frequent compilation errors and the feeling of having to re-explain the project due to a lack of context.",
        "**Solution**: Moving to a full-featured IDE with strong AI integration.",
        "**Recommended IDEs**: WebStorm or PyCharm (with the Tauri plugin), or Visual Studio Code (with the Rust and Tauri extensions).",
        "**Why these IDEs**: They provide a unified environment, deep language support for both Rust and the frontend, and most importantly, maintain conversation context with an AI assistant."
      ]
    },
    {
      "phase_title": "Solving the Context Problem",
      "details": [
        "**Frontend-Backend Communication**: Use Tauri's `invoke` commands to pass the chat history (maintained on the React frontend) to the Rust backend.",
        "**Rust Backend Logic**: The Rust function will receive the chat history, format it into a single prompt string, and pass it to the `llama.cpp` engine for inference.",
        "**AI Assistant Memory**: The AI assistant within the IDE will remember your conversation history within the project, eliminating the need to re-explain the project's details.",
        "**JSON Summary**: This summary is being provided as a solution to bridge the context from this web-based conversation to a new one in the IDE, as the conversations are not transferable between platforms."
      ]
    }
  ],
  "next_steps": [
    "1. **Select an IDE**: Use WebStorm or VS Code.",
    "2. **Install necessary plugins/extensions**: Install the Tauri and Rust plugins/extensions.",
    "3. **Set up AI Assistant**: Configure the AI assistant to use Gemini.",
    "4. **Re-implement Core Logic**: Rebuild the app's core features (conversation memory, time travel, stop button) using the new Tauri/Rust/C++ stack.",
    "5. **Use this JSON file**: Use this summary as your initial prompt and reference document when you start the new conversation in your IDE."
