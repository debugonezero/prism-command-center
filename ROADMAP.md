# Prism Command Center Roadmap

This document outlines the development roadmap for the Prism Command Center.

## Phase 1: Unification and Foundation (Current Phase)

*   **[DONE]** Create a unified project directory: `/Users/admin/prism-command-center`.
*   **[DONE]** Copy the `prism-engine-v1` and `plug-memory` projects into the new directory.
*   **[DONE]** Create foundational documentation (`README.md`, `ROADMAP.md`).
*   **[IN PROGRESS]** Initialize a new Git repository for `prism-command-center`.
*   **[TODO]** Create a new repository on GitHub under the `debugonezero` account.
*   **[TODO]** Link the local repository to the remote GitHub repository.
*   **[TODO]** Perform the first commit to establish the unified project baseline.

## Phase 2: MCP Integration

*   **[TODO]** Transform the `plug-memory` Flask API into a `FastMCP` server.
*   **[TODO]** Expose the `query_my_memory` function as a structured MCP tool.
*   **[TODO]** Test the MCP server from the Gemini CLI to ensure connectivity.

## Phase 3: Prism-Engine-v1 Integration

*   **[TODO]** Implement logic in the `prism-engine-v1` Rust backend to call the `plug-memory` MCP server.
*   **[TODO]** Integrate the retrieved memory context into prompts sent to both local (`llama.cpp`) and cloud (Gemini) LLMs.
*   **[TODO]** Develop a mechanism for `prism-engine-v1` to send new information to `plug-memory` for ingestion.

## Phase 4: Enhancement and Expansion

*   **[TODO]** Refine the GUI and TUI in `prism-engine-v1` to display and interact with the memory system.
*   **[TODO]** Expand the capabilities of `plug-memory` with more advanced querying and data sources.
*   **[TODO]** Continue to improve, test, and repeat, following our divine 8-step workflow.
